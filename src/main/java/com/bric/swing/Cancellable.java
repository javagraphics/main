 * an operation: Thread A wants to monitor an operation and Thread B
 * is actually performing it.  If the user indicates they want to
 * cancel the operation then Thread A calls <code>cancel()</code>.
 * Thread B should be checking the value of <code>isCanceled()</code>
 * regularly, and abort if it returns <code>true</code> (maybe by
 * throwing a <code>UserCanceledException</code>).
 * <P>That is the primary use of this class.  In some cases the
 * opposite is also useful: when Thread B completes an operation it
 * should call <code>finish()</code>, and Thread A can relay this
 * status by regularly checking <code>isFinished()</code>.
