/** This panel renders some refreshes through transitions.
 * <p>The {@link #startTransition(Transition, Runnable, float)} method
 * takes a snapshot of the current body of this panel, then executes the
 * <code>Runnable</code> argument, then takes a second snapshot, and then
 * executes the {@link com.bric.image.transition.Transition2D}.
 * <p>Internally the <code>TransitionPanel</code> uses a <code>CardLayout</code>
 * with two panels:
 * <ul><li>The body: this panel is accessible via {@link #getBody()}, and is at
 * your disposal to configure however you'd like. The only thing to keep in mind is:
 * setting it to invisible won't actually free up screen space like it normally would.
 * Instead you need to set this <code>TransitionPanel</code> to invisible.</li>
 * <li>The transition panel: this is only made visible during a transition. It is important
 * to completely obscure/remove the body during a transition, because otherwise more
 * complex UI components (like <code>JSpinners</code>) may flicker and render over
 * the transition for a split second. Also because this replaces the body: nothing in
 * the body is capable of receiving user input during the transition. (However this
 * shouldn't matter too much, because ideally a transition should be about a quarter
 * of a second.)</li></ul>
