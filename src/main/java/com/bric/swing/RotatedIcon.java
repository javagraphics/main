 * the sake of uniformity: this icon uses the same width and height
 * (calculated as the maximum that may be required for the transformed icon).
 * The source icon is always rendered in the center of this space.
 * <p>For example: if you have a 100x100 icon, then the RotatedIcon
 * wrapper will be 142x142 pixels (because it has to allow room for
 * the icon to rotate 45 degrees).
