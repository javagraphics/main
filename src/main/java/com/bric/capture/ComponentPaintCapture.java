/** This implementation of {@link ScreenCapture} relies on the
 * <code>java.awt.Component.paint(Graphic)</code> method.
 * <p>This is safer than the <code>RobotScreenCapture</code> (which involves
 * higher security levels), but as a result: this can't capture as much.
 * For example: if tooltips or palettes or menus float above a component,
 * then they probably won't be captured by this recording. Also this will
 * continue recording the component in question even if the user switches
 * windows/applications, but the Robot would capture exactly what the user
 * sees on their display.
