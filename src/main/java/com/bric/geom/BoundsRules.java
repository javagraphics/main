/** These are <code>AreaXRules</code> that are tested against
 * calculating the addition of several related shapes (as in clip art).
 * <p>This compares the bounds of the shapes in the queue, and
 * performs two possible optimization:
 * <ul><li>Unconnected Shapes: if the bounds of two operands don't touch
 * at all, then they may be merged.  ("Merging" is an optimized type
 * of addition.)</li>
 * <li>Inner Shapes: if an outer shape contains the bounds of an inner
 * shape, then the inner shape is dropped.  (Adding it would make no
 * difference to the final result.)</li></ul>
 * <p>These rules are only tested against the addition of shapes.  They
 * should work for other operations, but the performance gains might
 * be negligible.
